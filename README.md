## Description
[Deployed app](https://glacial-shelf-02751-221929193a76.herokuapp.com/)

This a book search site built with react. A user can type a search term in the search box and see search results displayed on the page.
After logging in,  users can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result.

Users can view their saved books on a separate page. They can also delete their saved books from the saved books page.

This project was to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
